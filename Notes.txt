Introduction to Mocking with Mockito

• Great unit tests => Easier Maintenance

• However, writing great units is NOT easy

    -> Applications have multiple layers
            -> Each class has multiple dependencies

• How do you write unit test for classes with multiple dependencies?

☐ Option 1: Stubs    // while doing this we have a lot of maintenance headAche
☐ Option 2: Mocks    // use this

        • Advantages of Mocks :
             ☐ Simpler to Write
             ☐ Easier to maintain
